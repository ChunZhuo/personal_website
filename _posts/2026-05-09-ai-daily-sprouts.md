## Top items

### OpenAI released new realtime voice models for the API

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Source: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/advancing-voice-intelligence-with-new-models-in-the-api/)
- Type: product release

OpenAI introduced GPT-Realtime-2, GPT-Realtime-Translate, and GPT-Realtime-Whisper for live voice reasoning, translation, and streaming transcription. Voice agents are moving from turn-taking demos toward tool-using, multilingual, realtime workflows. The 128K context window for GPT-Realtime-2 also makes longer voice sessions more practical.

Caveat: the performance claims are vendor-reported; production behavior still depends heavily on latency, tool design, and domain-specific evaluation.

### OpenAI made GPT-5.5 Instant the default ChatGPT model

- Date: 2026-05-05
- Source: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-5-instant/)
- Supporting source: [OpenAI system card](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-5-instant-system-card/)
- Type: model release and safety publication

GPT-5.5 Instant became ChatGPT's default model, with OpenAI reporting fewer hallucinated claims than GPT-5.3 Instant, especially on high-stakes prompts. The main direction is reliability rather than only raw capability: lower hallucination rates, better image/STEM handling, improved search decisions, and more transparent personalization controls.

Caveat: the hallucination reductions are from OpenAI's internal evaluations; independent replication would be useful.

### Google DeepMind highlighted AlphaEvolve's broader impact

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Source: [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-impact/)
- Type: research and deployment update

DeepMind reported AlphaEvolve applications across genomics, grid optimization, quantum circuits, mathematics, TPU design, storage systems, logistics, ads, and materials/life-science modeling. This is a strong signal that LLM-powered algorithm discovery is becoming operational infrastructure, not just a research demo.

Caveat: many claims are application-specific and come from Google or partner deployments; the generality of the approach depends on whether problems have reliable automated evaluators.

### U.S. CAISI expanded frontier AI model testing agreements

- Date: 2026-05-05
- Source: [NIST / CAISI](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2026/05/caisi-signs-agreements-regarding-frontier-ai-national-security-testing)
- Supporting source: [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/05/05/advancing-ai-evaluation-with-the-center-for-ai-standards-us-and-innovation-and-the-ai-security-institute-uk/)
- Type: policy / safety governance

CAISI announced agreements with Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and xAI for pre-deployment evaluations and targeted research on frontier AI capabilities and security risks. Frontier model assessment is becoming more formalized, especially for cybersecurity, biosecurity, chemical-risk, and national-security concerns.

Caveat: these are collaborative testing agreements, not a full public regulatory regime; details of model access, evaluation criteria, and enforcement remain limited.

### Anthropic expanded compute capacity and Claude usage limits

- Date: 2026-05-06
- Source: [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/higher-limits-spacex)
- Type: infrastructure / product capacity

Anthropic announced a SpaceX compute partnership and higher Claude Code/API usage limits, including doubled five-hour Claude Code limits for several paid plans. Capacity is still a strategic bottleneck for frontier AI products. More compute directly affects developer workflows, API availability, and model deployment scale.

### Anthropic announced an enterprise AI services company

- Date: 2026-05-04
- Source: [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/enterprise-ai-services-company)
- Type: enterprise AI deployment

Anthropic, Blackstone, Hellman & Friedman, and Goldman Sachs announced a new AI services company focused on helping mid-sized companies deploy Claude in core operations. Frontier labs are moving deeper into implementation services, not only model/API distribution.

## Recent papers and benchmarks

### Claw-Eval-Live: A Live Agent Benchmark for Evolving Real-World Workflows

- Date: 2026-05-01
- Source: [ChatPaper summary](https://chatpaper.com/paper/274070)
- Type: agent benchmark paper

Static agent benchmarks age quickly and often grade final answers without verifying whether the agent actually executed a workflow. Claw-Eval-Live separates a refreshable signal layer from reproducible, timestamped release snapshots so agent tasks can evolve with real workflow demand.

Caveat: I found a secondary paper page during this quick run; for a deeper digest, verify against the arXiv page or project repository.

### SkillLearnBench: Benchmarking Continual Learning Methods for Agent Skill Generation on Real-World Tasks

- Date: 2026-04-22
- Source: [Emergent Mind paper page](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2604.20087)
- Type: agent learning benchmark paper

Skills are increasingly used to make agents reliable on complex tasks, but automatically generating and improving those skills is still uneven. This benchmark evaluates continual skill learning across 20 verified tasks and measures skill quality, execution trajectory, and task outcome.

## Watch list

- Voice agents are becoming more tool-oriented and production-shaped.
- Frontier-model evaluation is shifting toward government-lab collaboration before deployment.
- Agent benchmarks are increasingly emphasizing live workflows, verification, and changing environments.
- Algorithm-discovery agents such as AlphaEvolve are moving from research examples into infrastructure and commercial optimization.
